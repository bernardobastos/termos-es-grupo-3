## 1. Software
- *"Computer software is the product that software professionals build and then support over the long term. It encompasses programs that execute within a computer of any size and architecture, content that is presented as the computer programs execute, and descriptive information in both hard copy and virtual forms that encompass virtually any electronic media."* [Pressman, Roger S. **Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach**.]
- *"Software is complex, and software applications often contain millions of lines of code. Software ranks among the most complex systems ever created by mankind, including large cities, country governments, large armies, large corporations, and so forth."* [VT Rajlich. **Software Engineering: The Current Practice**.]
- *"Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market."* [Sommerville, Ian. **Software Engineering**.]

## 2. Engenharia de software
- *"Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production."*[Sommerville, Ian. **Software Engineering**.]
- *"Software engineering encompasses a process, a collection of methods (practice) and an array of tools that allow professionals to build high-quality computer software."* [Pressman, Roger S. **Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach**.]
- *Software engineering is the field of computer science that deals with the building of software systems that are so large or so complex that they are built by a team or teams of engineers. Usually, these systems exist in multiple versions and are in service for many years.[...] We may define software engineering as the application of engineering to software.*  [Ghezzi, Carlo. **Fundamentals of software engineering**.]

## 3. Processo de software
- *"A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the production of a software product."* [Sommerville, Ian. **Software Engineering**.]
- *"Software process models often represent a networked sequence of activities, objects, transformations, and events that embody strategies for accomplishing software evolution."* [Scacchi, Walt. **Process Models in Software Engineering**.]
- Definição 3 [?]
 
## 4. Modelo de processo de Software
- *"A software process model is a simplified representation of a software process. Each process model represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process."* [Sommerville, Ian. **Software Engineering**.]
- Definição 2 [?]
- Definição 3 [?]

## 5. Qualidade de software
- Definição 1 [?]
- Definição 2 [?]

## 6. Modelo em Cascata
- *"The waterfall model This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on."* [Sommerville, Ian. **Software Engineering**.]
- *"The waterfall model, sometimes called the classic life cycle, suggests a systematic, sequential approach to software development that begins with customer specification of requirements and progresses through planning, modeling, construction, and deployment, culminating in ongoing support of the completed software"* [Pressman, Roger S. **Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach**.]
- *"Each phase has well defined starting and ending points, with clearly identifiable deliverables to the next phase."* [Ghezzi, Carlo. **Fundamentals of software engineering**.]
